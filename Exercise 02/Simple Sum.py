# Exercise 2: Simple Sums

# Delcaring a variable and initialing it with the integer value 8
number1 = 8

# Declaring a second variable and initialing it with the integer value 10.
number2 = 10 

# Declaring a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
sum_result = number1 + number2

# Printing the value of the sum to the console.
print("Sum of 8 and 10 is", sum_result)
