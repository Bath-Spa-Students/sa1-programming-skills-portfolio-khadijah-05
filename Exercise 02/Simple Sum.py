#Exercise 2: Simple Sums

#Delcaring a variable and initialing it with the integer value 8.
first_number = 8

#Declaring a second variable and initialing it with the integer value 10.
second_number = 10 

#Declaring a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
sum_of_these_numbers = first_number + second_number 

#Printing the value of the sum to the console.
print("Sum of 8 and 10 is", sum_of_these_numbers)
