#Exercise 7: Some Counting 

#Writing  a loop that counts up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1.
print("Counting up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1:")

#Ranges from 0 to 50, incrementing 1.
for a in range(0, 51): 

    #To start a new line.
 print("\n")  

#Writing a loop that counts down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1.
print("Counting down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1:")

#Ranges from 50 to 0, decrementing -1.
for b in range(50, -1, -1):  
    print(b, end=" ")

    #To start a new line.
print("\n")

#Writing a loop that counts up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1.
print("Counting up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1:")

#Ranges from 30 to 50, incrementing 1.
for c in range(30, 51):   
    print(c, end=" ")

    #To start the new line.
print("\n")

#Writing a loop that counts down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2.
print("Counting down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2:")

#Ranges from 50 to 10, decrementing -2.
for d in range(50, 9, -2):  
    print(d, end=" ")

    #To start the new line.
print("\n")

#Writing a loop that counts up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5.
print("Counting up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5:")

#Ranges from 100 to 200, incrementing 5.
for e in range(100, 201, 5):  
    print(e, end=" ")
    
    #To start the new line.
print("\n")
